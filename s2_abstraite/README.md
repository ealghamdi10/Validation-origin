# Hanoi Tower Problem

## This repository contains Python implementation of the Hanoi Tower problem.

The following files are included:

* **`Hanoi.py `**: Contains the implementation of the Hanoi class which solves the problem using recursion.  
* `HanoiConfiguration.py` : Defines the HanoiConfiguration class which represents a state of the Hanoi tower problem.  
* `HanoiGraph.py `: Defines the HanoiGraph class which represents the graph of the Hanoi tower problem.  
* `TransitionRelation.py` : Defines the TransitionRelation class which represents the transition relation of the Hanoi tower problem.  
* `nbits.py` : Contains a function to calculate the minimum number of bits necessary to represent a given number.  
* `noeud.py` : Defines the Noeud class which represents a node in the graph of the Hanoi tower problem.  
* **`test.py `**: Contains unit tests for the classes and functions defined in the other files.  
 
## How to Run

You can run the test script using the following command:

```
python test.py 
```
