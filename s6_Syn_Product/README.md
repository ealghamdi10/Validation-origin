### This code is a combination of several modules that perform a step-synchronous product of two soup 
### semantics in the form of a soup program. 
### The modules used are:

`main_s4.hanoi_on_entry1`

`s1_bfs.graph.predicate_finder`

`s3_IProxy.P_T_Proxy.ParentTraceProxy, getTrace`

`s4_Semantics.AConfig.AConfig`

`s4_Semantics.Rule.Rule`

`s4_Semantics.S_Program.SoupProgram`

`s4_Semantics.S_Semantics.SoupSemantics`

`s4_Semantics.Str2Tr.Str2Tr`

`s5_Alice_Bob.conf2.Conf2, Conf3`

`s5_Alice_Bob.ISS.InputSoupSemantics`

`s5_Alice_Bob.StepSynchProduct.StepSynchronousProduct`

`s5_Alice_Bob.Stutter.Stutter`

### Functionality

The code defines two main functions: **test** and **test2**.


 test function is responsible for creating an instance of the StepSynchronousProduct class, which takes two instances of SoupSemantics class as arguments. Then it #### calls the initial method to get the initial configuration of the product, followed by calling the enabledActions method to get the first enabled step and the rule #### associated with it. Finally, it executes this step and prints the result.

 test2 function performs a search of a particular predicate, represented by the fct_de_test function, in the step-synchronous product using the predicate_finder #### method from the s1_bfs.graph module. The Str2Tr class is used to translate the product into the trace. The trace is then used by the ParentTraceProxy to store the #### results of the search. The final result of the search is retrieved using the getTrace method and printed to the console.
