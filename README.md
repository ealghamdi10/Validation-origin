# Project validation

### This repository contains the implementation of an AI project with a focus on search algorithms, abstraction, proxy design pattern and semantics. The project is divided into four main folders:


[s1_bfs](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/blob/main/main_s1.py): Contains the implementation of breadth-first search algorithm.  

[s2_abstraite](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s2_abstraite): Contains the implementation of an abstract class and methods for creating a problem abstraction.  

[s3_IProxy](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s3_IProxy): Contains the implementation of the proxy design pattern for the AI problem.  

[s4_Semantics](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s4_Semantics): Contains the implementation of the semantics of the AI problem.  
[s5_Alice_Bob](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s5_Alice_Bob):   
[s6_Sny_Product](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s6_Syn_Product):  
[s7_Test_SSP](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s7_Test_SSP):

## How to Run
To run the code in each folder, you will need to navigate to that folder in the command line and run the appropriate script. For example, to run the code in the s1_bfs folder, use the following command:
```
python s1_bfs/main.py
```
