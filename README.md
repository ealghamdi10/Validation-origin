# Project validation

#### ### This repository contains the implementation of an AI project with a focus on search algorithms, abstraction, proxy design pattern and semantics. The project is divided into four main folders:


[s1_bfs](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/blob/main/main_s1.py): Contains the implementation of breadth-first search algorithm.  

[s2_abstraite](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s2_abstraite): Contains the implementation of an abstract class and methods for creating a problem abstraction.  

[s3_IProxy](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s3_IProxy): Contains the implementation of the proxy design pattern for the AI problem.  

[s4_Semantics](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s4_Semantics): Contains the implementation of the semantics of the AI problem.  
[s5_Alice_Bob](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s5_Alice_Bob): Contains the implementation of the Alice & Bob problem. It includes the configuration, rules and input semantics.  
[s6_Sny_Product](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s6_Syn_Product): Contains the implementation of the step-synchronous product, which is a combination of two different problem instances.  
[s7_Test_SSP](https://github.com/ealghamdi10/Validation-origin/tree/main/s7_Test_SSP): Contains the test cases for the step-synchronous product and its results.

## How to Run
The main file, test.py, demonstrates how to use the implemented classes and functions to find a solution to the Alice & Bob problem. It uses breadth-first search, abstraction, proxy design pattern, and semantics to find a solution. The result is a trace that shows the steps taken to solve the problem.

###### In order to run the project, clone the repository and run the test.py file using python3. The project was implemented in Python and requires the following packages to be installed:

```java
*Graph
S_Program
S_Semantics
Str2Tr
AB2
conf2
ISS
StepSynchProduct*
```

After running the test.py file, the trace of the solution will be displayed on the console.
